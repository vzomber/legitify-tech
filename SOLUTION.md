I've tried also making possible to change order of the tickets, but that would require more time to implement.

Question to MP:
1. What is the text limit for the ticket description/title?
2. Title and description are different things, but we have only one field to input. I used pipe | as a dilimiter. Is it ok?
3. In design textarea used instead of input, which breaks submit-by-enter, but, from the other hand, you can use enter to make new line. Just an info.
4. In real situation all this tickets would be nice to save somewhere, I could use local storage for that. 
5. Any possibilities to add new column etc?
